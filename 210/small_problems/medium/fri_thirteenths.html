/* Write a function that returns the number of Friday the 13ths in the year 
passed in as an argument. You may assume that the year is greater than 1752 
(when the modern Gregorian Calendar was adopted by the United Kingdom), and you 
may assume that the same calendar will remain in use for the foreseeable future.

I: year
O: number of Friday the 13ths
R: year will be greater than 1752.

D: Date objects for the year

A: 
Initialize result = 0
Loop through months
  Create a date objects representing each 13th
  if it's a friday, increment result.
