To be able to process multiple invoices, we'll need to have a factory method that we can use to create invoices. The requirements for this factory function are the following:

I: object which can override the defaults.
O: an invoice object
  properties: 
    phone, 
    internet, 
    total method: returns this.phone + this.internet
  defaults: 
    phone 3000, 
    internet 5500

D: object as described above.

Now let's build a factory function to create payments. The function can take an object argument in one of the 3 forms:

payment for one service, such as, {internet: 1000}, {phone: 1000}
payment for both services, such as, {internet: 2000, phone: 1000}
payment with just an amount property, such as {amount: 2000}.
and should return an object that has paid services, and a total method that returns the payment total. If the amount property is not present, this should return the sum of phone and internet services; if the amount property is present, just return the value of that property.

I: object with an amount property, or one service, or both services.
O: object with properties:
    phone:
    internet:
    total: function phone + internet, or if amount property is present, just return this.
