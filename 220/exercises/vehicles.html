Set their constructor properties back to their own named functions, which will allow instances of each constructor to display that it is a type of Coupe or Motorcycle rather than Vehicle. Create an instance of coupe and motorcycle and log both to verify they are different object types. Check the coupe's instanceof (coupe instanceof Coupe) against the Coupe, Vehicle, and Motorcycle constructors to see how the prototypes are inherited.
